## 🌟 About Me
- 🎓 **PhD student (0th year)** at the **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences**, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health.  
- 🔬 My research focuses on **Computational Biology**, where I explore how data-driven methods can unlock the secrets of biological systems and advance healthcare.  
- 🧬 If I am not dealing with algorithms, I am busy trying to solve math problems and making sense of the universe (or at least trying to!).  
- 🤖 Exploring the fascinating worlds of **Statistics**, **Probability**, and the ever-growing field of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**.
- ✍️ Passionate about **mathematical foundations** that power algorithms, and sharing my journey through **open-source projects** on GitHub.

## ✨ Featured Projects

- 🔗 **[math](https://github.com/Expectorpatro/math)** - A love letter to my undergraduate years: I’m compiling all the knowledge I learned, filling in missing details from textbooks, and trying to present it all in a more logical, organized manner. Currently, it’s a LaTeX project—no PDFs, so get ready to compile it yourself!  
- 💹 **[stock](https://github.com/Expectorpatro/stock)** - The world of stocks, simplified: A modest start to a journey with my friend in the stock market. It’s a work in progress, but who knows, one day we might just become stock market moguls! 💰💸  
- 📚 **[advanced_algebra](https://github.com/Expectorpatro/advanced_algebra)** - A deep dive into **Advanced Algebra**: I’ve compiled most of the exercises from my junior year’s special course. Ready to get algebraic?  
- 🧬 **[MLAS](https://github.com/Expectorpatro/MLAS)** - The code from my first published paper in **Horticulturae**! We used computational methods to find genes in **Chinese cabbage** that could potentially respond to abiotic stresses (cold, heat, salt, and drought). 
- 🤖 **[BERT](https://github.com/Expectorpatro/BERT)** - From scratch, with love: A fully custom **BERT model** using **PyTorch**, just the **Masked Language Model (MLM)** task for now. Because sometimes you just need to build things yourself, right?  
- 📊 **[sampling-method](https://github.com/Expectorpatro/sampling-method)** - Turning **sampling surveys** into something more than just class notes: I transformed my lecture notes into a clean **LaTeX**-coded PDF, with code for practical applications. A neat little guide for anyone who’s curious about statistical sampling methods!  👉 You’d better check out the **sampling survey section** in my **[math](https://github.com/Expectorpatro/math)** repo, where I’ve updated and expanded on it with more details and fresh insights!
